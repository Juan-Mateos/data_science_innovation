This repo contains links to resources used in a session about Data Science for Innovation Studies I am using in a course on Advanced Methods for Innovation Studies at the University of Manchester, April 2018.


## Methods and tools
Salganik, M. (2017): 'Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age' [link to book site](http://www.bitbybitbook.com/). Princeton: Princeton University Press. The digital revolution has greatly expanded the data sources and methods that social scientists can use in their research. This book is an excellent primer on the opportunities and some of the risks.

Breiman, L. (2010): 'Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures' [link](http://www2.math.uu.se/~thulin/mm/breiman.pdf): Discusses differences between how statisticians (and social scientists) use models, and the machine learning approach.

Taddy, M. (2018): 'The Technological Elements of Artificial Intelligence'. [link](http://www.nber.org/papers/w24301): Introduces key concepts and methods from the 'new wave' of Machine Learning and AI research.

Crawford, K. (2011): 'Six provocations for big data' [link](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1926431): Prescient review of some important risks from big data that all researchers and practitioners need to be aware of.

Romer, P. (2018): 'Jupyter, Mathematica, and the Future of the Research Paper' [link](https://paulromer.net/jupyter-mathematica-and-the-future-of-the-research-paper/): Argues that using open source analysis tools is not only about functionality but also about ethics (I agree).

## Applications
Bakhshi and Mateos-Garcia, 2016: 'New Data for Innovation Policy' [link](https://www.oecd.org/sti/106%20-%20Bakhshi%20and%20Mateos-Garcia%202016%20-%20New%20Data%20for%20Innovation%20Policy.pdf): Sets out a rationale for using new data and data science for innovation policy, provides examples of ongoing analyses, and discusses organisational implications.

Horton, J. and Tambe, P. (2015): 'Labor Economists Get Their Microscope: Big Data and Labor Market Analysis' [link](http://john-joseph-horton.com/papers/labor_econ_microscope.pdf): Shows new research opportunities for labour market economists being opened up by big data.

Fortunato et al. (2018): 'Science of science' [link](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6379/eaao0185): New developments in the use of big datasets and network analysis and complexity research to understand how science evolves.
